    <h1>This is some information about ME.</h1>

    <h2>Hello my names Gustavo Anjel Percastre:</h2>
    <p>I like reading novels mostly online ones. And I mostly use the app Wattpad to do it.</p>
    <p>I also own an xbox one and like to play games on it like the recent zombie game that came out Back 4 Blood. I have been only playing that game trying to beat all the campaign missions.</p>
    <p>And I took the HTML course before this one. So hopefully I can put those lessons to good use.</p>

<h3>Here is a picture of me petting my dog:</h3>
