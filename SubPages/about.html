    <h1>This is some information about ME.</h1>

    <p>Hello my names Gustavo Anjel Percastre:</p>
    <p>I like reading novels mostly online ones. And I mostly use the app Wattpad to do it.</p>
    <p>I also own a xbox one and like to play games on it like the recent zombie game that came out Back 4 Blood. I have been only playing that game trying to beat all the campain missions.</p>
    <p>And I took the html course before this one. So hopefully I can put those lesson to good use.</p>

<h2>Here is a picture of me petting my dog:</h2>
