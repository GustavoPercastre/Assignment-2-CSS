    <h2>What do you hope to learn in your CSS course?</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>I would like to learn how to better style my webpages with colors that actually match and not just ones that I picked at random or because they looked cool to me.</li>
            <li>I would also like to learn how to better use fonts on my webpages.</li>
            <li>And finally I would also like to learn how to better place all my HTML elements on my webpages.</li>
        </ul>
</main>
